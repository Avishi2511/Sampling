#Sampling

This project evaluates the performance of five machine learning models across five different datasets. The results are organized into a 5x5 table, where each row corresponds to a dataset (sample) and each column corresponds to the accuracy of a model.

## Overview

The following machine learning models were evaluated:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. Gradient Boosting Classifier

Each dataset (`Sample_1.csv` to `Sample_5.csv`) contains features and a `Class` column, which is the target variable. The evaluation is done using the **accuracy score** metric.
